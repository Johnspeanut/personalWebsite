## 3.1 What was the most challenging piece of this assignment? Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS? How long did this overall assignment take you?

The most challenging piece of this assignment is how to design the layout of the website. I also find that the color combination of elements is tricky.
I think it's easy to work with HTML and CSS. And the assignment took me about 20 hours.

## 3.2 What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?

When I define font size for text, I use em unit instead of px. In this way the text of the website is friendly for mobile.

I use a set of font family for the website. If the first option of font family is not supported in mobile service, it will use the second option of the font family.

## 3.3 What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website? Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?

When I developed the design of the website, I take the following into account.
1)The website is accessible around the world.
2)The items of the website are readible and user-friendly.
3)The design of the website is elegant and informative. Visitors can get key information in a few seconds.

## 3.4 Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future?

I would like to build a dynamic website and put the backend on AWS service. More specifically, I could add user authentication and authorization to my website. Users can sign up accounts and log in the website with their accounts. Furthermore, they can post comments on the website.

## 3.5 How many hours did you spend on this assignment?

I spent more than 20 hours on this assigment.
